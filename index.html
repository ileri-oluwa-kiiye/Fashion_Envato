                        I began acquired his love for fashion when he was a young boy where he

                        While in New York, I was employed in the Charivari Boutique where president
                        of the company, Barbara Weiser, noticed my potential and passion for unique 
                        fashion and helped me launch my first fashion collection. My passion for African 
                        fashion is profound. “Everything begins for me with the print and fabric, which 
                        usually has some shine,” exclaims Faturoti. My deep African roots, as well as 
                        extensive global experience with having lived and worked in New York and Milan
                        have been instrumental in her success and international spotlight.

                        My pieces are also sold globally in the UK, US, and France. Anthony uses his
                        talent to make an impact on the community through a mentoring program he runs
                        that helps young and upcoming Nigerian designers excel and compete on a 
                        global platform. Nature, colors, and artwork are his main sources of inspiration.
